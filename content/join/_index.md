# Join us

The Park Lab is looking for students broadly interested in understanding biological processes---particularly in the areas of epidemiology and ecology---through the use of mathematical and statistical models. We welcome motivated students from diverse academic backgrounds who are curious, collaborative, and eager to learn.

I expect every student to work on their own independent projects. Topics outlined in the [Research](https://parklab-snu.github.io/research/) tab are long-term goals, which can require advanced quantitative skills and longer-term time commitments. These questions are likely better suited for PhD students. Instead, I have written down some [ideas](https://parklab-snu.github.io/ideas) for shorter-term projects that undergraduate students or early graduate students can work on. I'm also happy to help students develop their own ideas that are not listed in either of those tabs.

## Graduate students

We highly encourage prospective graduate students to spend time in our lab first as an intern. If you are interested in joining our lab, please send me (sangwoopark@snu.ac.kr) your CV, transcript, and your research interests (0.5 pages in English).

## Undergraduate students

If you are interested in joining our lab as an undergraduate intern, please send me (sangwoopark@snu.ac.kr) your CV, transcript, and a brief description of your research interests (either in Korean or English). You do not need an advanced background in mathematics or statistics as most of the relevant skills can be learned in the lab. Nonetheless, some basic knowledge in mathematics (calculus and linear algebra), statistics (regression), and programming (R) will be helpful.
