# Join us

The Park Lab is looking for students broadly interested in understanding biological processes---particularly in the areas of epidemiology and ecology---through the use of mathematical and statistical models. We welcome motivated students from diverse academic backgrounds who are curious, collaborative, and eager to learn.

## Graduate students

We highly encourage prospective graduate students to spend time in our lab first as an intern. If you are interested in joining our lab, please send me (sangwoopark@snu.ac.kr) your CV, transcript, and your research interests (0.5 pages in English).

## Undergraduate students

If you are interested in joining our lab as an undergraduate intern, please send me (sangwoopark@snu.ac.kr) your CV, transcript, and a brief description of your research interests (either in Korean or English). You do not need an advanced background in mathematics or statistics as most of the relevant skills can be learned in the lab. Nonetheless, some basic knowledge in mathematics (calculus and linear algebra), statistics (regression), and programming (R) will be helpful.

## Project ideas

Here are some project topics that undergraduate students and junior graduate students might consider.

### Epidemics

- Analyses of epidemic time series using basic mathematical models and comparing their dynamics across space and time. See analyses of [Enterovirus D68](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.abd2400), [Mycoplasma pneumoniae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436524000690), and [RSV](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.02.25323095v1). Also see the following [tutorial](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-024-01326-9). 
- [Theoretical explorations of the coupling between human behavior and epidemiology](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2009911117)
- Impact of stochasticity on epidemic dynamics and persistence. This project can take either theoretical or statistical approaches. See the following work on [pathogen resilience](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.13.659551v2.abstract) as a reference.
- Theoretical explorations of relationship between climate, behavior, and disease

### Ecology

- Revisiting historical examples with modern quantitative tools
