2. Install `ggplot2` for generating figures
3. Install `tidyr` and `dplyr` for data processing

## Tutorials

You do not have to read any of these in advance to join the lab. They’re just resources I’ve personally found valuable over the course of my research career.

1. For basic epidemic modeling, refer to [Epidemics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-12056-5) by Ottar N. Bjørnstad. 
2. For basic epidemic model fitting, refer to [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-024-01326-9). 
3. For general statistical and mathematical modeling in ecology, refer to [Ecological Models and Data in R](ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/book.pdf) by Ben Bolker.
4. Lecture notes on [Theoretical Community Ecology](https://stefanoallesina.github.io/Theoretical_Community_Ecology/) by Stefano Allesina.
