# Ideas

Here are some project ideas that undergraduate students and junior graduate students might consider.

## Epidemics

- Analyses of epidemic time series using basic mathematical models and comparing their dynamics across space and time. See analyses of [Enterovirus D68](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.abd2400), [Mycoplasma pneumoniae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436524000690), and [RSV](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.02.25323095v1). Also see the following [tutorial](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-024-01326-9). 
- Theoretical explorations of the coupling between [human behavior and epidemiology](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2009911117)
- Theoretical explorations of relationship between climate, behavior, and disease
- Understanding the impact of COVID-19 interventions on epidemic dynamics. See the following work on [pathogen resilience](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.13.659551v2.abstract) as a reference.
- Understanding the impact of stochasticity on epidemic dynamics and persistence. This project can take either theoretical or statistical approaches. See the following work on [pathogen resilience](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.13.659551v2.abstract) as a reference.

## Ecology

- Revisiting historical examples with modern quantitative tools
